## Usage
Script can be executed without any parameters. You will be then prompted to provide `LAUNCHER_HASH` and `POOL_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`

Scrip also accepts various parameters. Please remember that you do not have to provide required parameters that have already a default value.
 


| Parameter | Description | Type | Default | Required? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| `-LAUNCHER_HASH [your_launcher_id]` | Launcher ID of NFT that you want to recover. Can be obtained executing "chia plotnft show" in Chia | `string` | Empty | Yes |
| `-POOL_CONTRACT_ADDRESS [your_pool_contract_address]` | Pool contract address of NFT that you want to recover. Can be obtained executing "chia plotnft show" in Chia | `string` | Empty | Yes |
| `-fingerprint [wallet_fingerprint]` | Wallet fingerprint. If you have only one wallet, you do not need to provide this, as it will be found automatically | `string` | Empty | No |
| `-sleep [hours]` | If provided will run script in a infinite loop, repeating recovery in the provided interval | `Integer` | `0` | No |
| `-nettype [nettype]` | (`mainnet` or `testnet`) Part of the folder path where fork store its data  (please remember that silicoin is using `mainnet` folder) | `string` | `mainnet` | Yes |
| `-blockchains [fork1], [fork2], [fork3]...` | If not provided will run recovery for `flora`. Array of strings, accepts multiple values separated by comma | `string array` | `flora` | Yes |


#### Usage examples

* One time recovery of coins in Beet blockchain:

   `./beet_recovery.ps1 -POOL_CONTRACT_ADDRESS [your_pool_contract_address] -LAUNCHER_HASH [your_launcher_id]`   

* One time recovery of coins in Beet blockchain when multiple wallet are available:

   `./beet_recovery.ps1 -POOL_CONTRACT_ADDRESS [your_pool_contract_address] -LAUNCHER_HASH [your_launcher_id] -fingerprint [wallet_fingerprint]`   

* One time recovery of coins in Beet and Silicoin blockchains:

   `./beet_recovery.ps1 -POOL_CONTRACT_ADDRESS [your_pool_contract_address] -LAUNCHER_HASH [your_launcher_id] -blockchains flora, silicoin`   

* Recovery of coins in Beet and Silicoin blockchains in a loop, executing the recovery every 24 hours:

   `./beet_recovery.ps1 -POOL_CONTRACT_ADDRESS [your_pool_contract_address] -LAUNCHER_HASH [your_launcher_id] -blockchains flora, silicoin -sleep 24`
